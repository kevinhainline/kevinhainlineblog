While this video is almost a half hour, you could get by with watching the first ten minutes. You could even just watch the first five minutes, if you were pressed for time. That's all you really need to understand what makes this video special to me. 

I grew up in Southern California, and when I was a kid, if you were bored and flipping through channels, you would often come across this very weird, very watchable show, *California's Gold*. *California's Gold* was the brainchild of Huell Howser, a Tennessee-born-U.S. Marine-turned-TV-reporter whose name is literally a portmanteau of his parent's names: Harold and Jewell. Each week, for 24 seasons (and 443 episodes!), Huell would report on a strange cultural site in California, with his wonderful/insane southern accent and his broad charm.  He would go all over the state, highlighting neighborhoods and museums and historical sites and natural beauty and [avocado dogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l99Ek4YtTuw). He is captivating to watch, because he came off as both incredibly enthusiastic, and kind to the point of seeming to be very dumb. I loved watching him.

(The comedian and impressionist [James Adomian does a perfect Huell Howser impersonation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H6fhXcwqaI), I suppose only for the weird subset of people who enjoyed alternative comedy in Los Angeles and had watched this KCET television show. When Howser died, [Adomian wrote an incredibly touching memorial for him that is worth a read](https://www.kcet.org/tv-talk/comedian-james-adomian-remembers-huell-howser).)

The best opening to an episode of *California's Gold* is the video above. Maybe you [want to watch the beginning of another episode of *California's Gold*](https://blogs.chapman.edu/huell-howser-archives/category/californias-gold/) to set the stage for how weird the Joe Rinaudo episode is. But you don't really need to (although they're great, and well worth watching) in order to appreciate the strangeness of this video. After the utterly charming shout-out to the California Teacher's Association, and a commercial for British Petroleum (it's cute to watch them try to launder their image by supporting public television), we finally get Huell and his weird tall microphone. He gives the briefest of introductions, indicating that normally episodes start with more of an interview, but instead, as a special treat, "we're startin' off with a bang." 

Hit it Joe.

You know, I was going to write a description, but it's more fun to just watch. This little video, and Joe Rinaudo, was the basis for [a sketch in Season 1 of *I Think You Should Leave*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7f9xTPI9eo), which is pretty funny, but it's maybe not nearly as funny as just seeing Joe Rinaudo having a good time for *California's Gold*.
